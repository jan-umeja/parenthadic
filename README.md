# parenthadic
parenthadic is a number system i invented that only uses parentheses (you can use any two characters but i'm using parentheses here)
1. factorize: 42 = 2 * 3 * 7
2. write the nth prime as (n): (1)(2)(4)

repeat until you're left with 1s, and remove them

some examples:<br>
42 = ()(())(()())<br>
413 = (()())(((()())))<br>
2763 = (())(())((())(())(()()))<br>
71421 = (())(()())(()()())(((()(()))))<br>
286078 = ()(()(()))(()()()((())(()(()))))

included programs:
- convert a specific number to parenthadic
- convert all numbers from 1 to an input
